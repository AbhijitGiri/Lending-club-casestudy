## <ins>Introduction</ins>

We are given data about borrowers who have taken loans of various amounts from the Lending Club. The data involves various customer related information such as annual income,
State, Loan Amount, Grade, Employment Length, Property type, Loan Purpose etc. Many other borrower performance related data is also present in the dataset. For each of the borrower we have been given if the borrower has been Fully Paid or has defaulted the loan. 

## <ins>Goal</ins>

The goal of this case study is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the various relevant data given to us and try to determine the driving factors which can tell if a borrower is likely to default the loan.

## <ins>Conclusions</ins>
1.The company should avoid giving loan to borrowers whose income is below $40000 and who are requesting a loan amount greater than $20000.<br>
2.The company should restrict borrowers who are belonging to Low Income Category and staying in Rent or Mortgage property and requesting loan greater than $15000 for the purpose of consolidation of debt.<br>
3.Borrowers belong to Grade C,D,E have higher chance of defaulting. Company should be careful before sanctioning loan to such borrowers depending upon loan amount. <br>
4.Apart from debt consolidation, borrowing taking high value loans for the purpose of credit card payment, small business and education and having less income have more chance of defaulting. <br>
5.Borrowers belonging to state CA,FL, NY have high chance of defaulting. Hence borrowers belonging to these states having low income have high chance of defaulting based on Loan amounts. Such borrowers needs to be restricted.<br>
6.The company can increase its profits in states having high number of High Income group borrowers by charging more interest rate. The states are NJ,VA,DC,MD.<br>
7.For borrowers taking loan for renewable energy the company can further reduce interest rates to attract more customers.<br>
